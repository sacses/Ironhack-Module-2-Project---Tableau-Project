# Ironhack-Module-2-Project---Tableau-Project

In this project I used a dataset from the World Bank that contained the outcome of the responses to a survery sent to all countries in regards to payment methods used, number of payments and total $ amount per year.

I used Tableau to plot the results of the initial analysis, comprising year and total amount spent throgh Online vs. Offline payment methods.
